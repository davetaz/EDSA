<p>While the data loads, here's a little about what you will see appear.</p>

<p>The survey cross filter dashboard allows you to interactively browse the results from from the EDSA demand analysis &ndash; a combination of online survey and interviews responses.</p>

<p>E.g., to look at the data from <i>Managers</i> in the <i>UK</i>, select "Manager" in the <i>Role</i> pie chart, and then the UK in the <i>Map</i> view. This will apply this filter to the view. Deselect to restore to the default view or refresh the page.</p>

<p>All charts apart from the word cloud can be used to filter the data.<br />

<p>The default view shows all data:
<ul>
	<li>The <i>Map</i> view shows locations of the respondents.</li>
	<li>The <i>Role</i> pie chart shows the primary role of the respondents, e.g., data scientist, manager, other.</li>
	<li>The <i>Sector</i> bar chart shows the respondents' primary industry sector.</li>
	<li>The <i>Which skills are essential for a data scientist?</i> chart shows the key areas of data science respondents considered as <i>essential</i>, <i>desirable</i> or <i>not required</i> for a data scientist to have.</li>
	<li>The <i>You or your teams current expertise</i> donut charts show the current level of expertise in 8 key data science areas that respondents were asked to rate. If you filter to manager this was answered for their team, otherwise it was for the indicidual themselves.</li>
	<li>The <i>Word Cloud</i> shows key tools, languages and techniques that have been rated as important to respondents. Size maps to frequency of mention.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>The dashboard shows a live view of all submitted data. A filter however excludes inconsistent or incomplete results. Because this may be updated, data currently available may be excluded at a later time.
