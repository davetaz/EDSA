# About the survey cross filter dashboard

The survey cross filter dashboard allows you to interactively browse the results obtained from a combination of the online and in person surveys that form part of the demand analysis for the EDSA project.

The default view shows all the data including:

* The home country of for the submitter of the data is shown by the map
* The primary role of the person is shown on the pie chart (data scientist, manager, other)
* The sector, mapped into the European standard sectors is shown in the bar chart (top right)
* "Which areas are essential" chart shows the key areas of expertise that are rated as "essential", "desirable" and "not required"
* The set of donut charts show the current level of expertise in the 8 key areas which survey contributors as asked to rate
* The word cloud shows key tools and skills that have been rated as important to survey contributors, the size is the number of times that skills is mentioned.

Everything except the word cloud can be used to filter the data. For instance if you wanted to find out the views only on manager in the UK. They you can click "manager" in the role pie chart, and also click on the UK in the map. This will filter all the rest of the data. To restore back to default view you can either un-click the options selected, or refresh the page.

This dashboard shows a live view on all submitted data. Although there is an automatic spam filter for bad results, this does not guarantee to catch all bad data. Occasionally a manual check is done by the project team. Thus we cannot guarantee that all data will remain in perpetuity.
