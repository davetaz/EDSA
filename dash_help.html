<h2>What is the EDSA dashboard?</h2>
<p>
The <strong>EDSA dashboard</strong> visualises the results of EDSA’s research into data science skills in Europe, and allows you to investigate the data yourself.
</p>
<p>
The results will help us to assess the demand for data science training in Europe and create new learning materials to help keep Europe ahead in this crucial domain.
</p>
<p>
The results of the research will directly influence the training and curriculum we create!
</p>
<p>
We want to collect data from every European country and every sector to do this.
</p>

<h2>What is the dashboard showing me?</h2>
<p>
<strong>Click on a country</strong> to reveal the aggregated and anonymised results of the data collected from focus groups, one-to-one interviews and data from the online survey. Countries in red, show areas where data has been collected.

<strong>Select a country</strong> to reveal which data science skills those surveyed have the greatest capability in. The radar graph displayed on the left of the screen represents the capabilities of survey respondents in this country for each of the key aspects of data science on a scale of 0 (no knowledge) to 4 (leading expert).

Take a look at the <strong>EDSA trend tracker</strong> at the bottom of the dashboard. It collects over 2000 data points each day from LinkedIn. We’re searching for key data science terms in advertised job profiles so that we can see the most advertised data science skills. When you click on a country from the map you can see the demand for data science skills in that country's job market.

<p>
Using the <strong>EDSA trend tracker</strong> at the bottom of the dashboard, you can also explore the demand for specific skills within each axis of the radar graph. Click on one of the 8 skill areas on the radar graph and the trend tracker will display the demand for that skill.

<p>
The <strong>EDSA trend tracker</strong> also shows you how the demand for each skill area breaks down for specific skills. Each colour on the trend tracker represents a specific skill within that skill area, stacked according to size. Click the ? next to the skill area in the radar graph to discover which specific skills are being measured.
