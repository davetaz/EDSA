## 8 key areas of Data Science

This document explores the 8 key areas of Data Science as used in the European Data Science Academy project.

### Background

Data science is regarded as a discipline that requires many skills taken from other disciplines, from Computer Science and Math to Design. The most widely accepted intepretations of this skills set is taken from the [Data Science venn diagram by Drew Conway](http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram). Note that while there are three main parts to this venn diagram, the overlaps introduce two additional diciplines of traditional research  and machine learning, giving five areas in total. 

The EDSA project has further developed up top of the five areas from the Venn Diagram as well as taking influences from current trend analysis and pilot studies to create the eight areas outlined below.

### Advanced computing and programming

Originally called hacking skills in the venn diagram, this aspect focuses not on what the computer can do for you (e.g. run excel) but what you can do with the computer (new code), hense the use of the word 'hacking'.

This covers the ability to program (or code) a solution to a problem or use a computer (or other piece of technology) in a novel way in problem solving. 

### Big data

Being able to deal with large volumes of data arriving at high velocity is seen as a new area of expertise beyond the traditional data collection and analysis. The understanding of how to process streaming data and create large threaded processes for analysing data (using advanced computing and programming skills) is essential here. 

### Business intelligence and domain expertise

Having the skills doesn't necessary translate into insight unless you have the business/organisational processes and domain knowledge. Without this knowledge, understanding the nuances of how the data was collected, the impact of different types of analysis and potential conflicts will be difficult to identify. For example if you are processing healthcare data, knowing when different diagnosis and proceedures are following in different practices are essential to be able to compare the data from different areas.

### Data collection and analysis

This aspect covers the core data handling skills of undertsnading data structures, algorithms and databasing. Additionaly once data is collected, how can basic insight be drawn from the data, such as summary statistics.

### Data interpretation and visualisation

Data interpretation builds from the analysis and looks at the application into a specific domain. In other words, what impact do the summary statistics have, if any? Building from the intepretation it is then important to effectively communicate the insight to others through data visualisation. 

### Math and statistics

Essential in all data analysis is the statistical knowledge to make sense of the data without making fatal errors in the analysis. Everything from using the wrong average to finding a non-significant result can have a profound effect on the domain, not always for the better.

### Machine learning and prediction

A big part of data science focusses on the prediction of future trends. With the amount of data growing, machine learning algoirthms can help significantly in the identification of emerging trends as well as classificaition of existing data. Understanding the basics of machine learning can help significantly in predicting the impact of decisions. 

### Open source tools and concepts

Given the speed that technology is eveolving, keeping up can be very challenging, both for organisations and individuals alike. Significant also is the fact that the community as a whole moves a lot faster than individuals and organisations on their own. Thus open source tools and open innovation are moving at a pace and it is essential for a good data scientist to have the skills to take advantage of new technologies, rather than waiting for the off-the-shelf commercial solution. A good data scientist should also be comfortable in this community and potentially contribute back.
