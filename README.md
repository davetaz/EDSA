##Adding new terms to the harvester

This has to be done by create a new file, not adding the term to an existing one. Once the translation of the term is done it can be added to an existing file.

So create a file with the term in english e.g.

gb
"my new term"

Then run it through the translator to add all of the other required languages.

Once done you can add the new line to the bottom of an existing file, the lnaguages are sorted alphabetically, so they will line up.
